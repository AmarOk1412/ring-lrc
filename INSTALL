Basic Installation
==================

These are generic installation instructions.


To install the appplication, type the following commands in a console, while in the root directory of this application:

	mkdir -p build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr # Add -DENABLE_VIDEO=true if you want experimental video support
	make -j3
	sudo make install

To generate a source tarball (sflphone-cliend-kde.tar.xz), just execute release.sh

Explaination
==================

This script will configure and prepare the compilation and installation of the program.

All needed files will be built in "build" directory.
So you have to go to this directory:

	cd build

Then execute the Makefile, to compile the application (src, doc...)

	make

Then install it all using:

	sudo make install

You have to use "sudo" to be able to install the program in a protected directory (which is the case by default and most of the time).
Therefore it will ask for your system password.
If you don't have this password or for any reason you want to install the program in a non-protected directory, refer to the Options below.

OS X Install
============

# Install necessary tools:
brew install dbus cmake
brew install qt5 --with-d-bus
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.3.2/

# First make sure you have built sflphone daemon for OS X. You currently need some special
# care, but as the port matures, that should get fixed.

cd ~/sflphone-kde/src/lib/
install_name_tool -id @executable_path/libsflphone.0.dylib libsflphone.0.dylib

mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug for compiling with debug symbols]
make

install_name_tool -change @rpath/libsflphone.0.dylib @executable_path/libsflphone.0.dylib libqtsflphone.1.4.1.dylib
install_name_tool -id @executable_path/libqtsflphone.1.4.1.dylib libqtsflphone.1.4.1.dylib

# You can now use thes libraries in a QtCreator project. Don't forget to copy both dylibs inside
# your .app/Contents/MacOS/
